                bonafide guide to the user and the services are rendered as soon as availed, therefore there is no
                provision for refund of fee paid by the User/s. The user/s is therefore deemed to have understood and
                accepted that once any amount is paid to The Inseparable as per the services availed, there shall be no
                refund of the said amount.But surely you can contact <b>learnejo@gmail.com</b> we will hear you</p>
